# Hey there, nice to meet you! ðŸ˜Ž

A philosopher by training, I recently switched careers and completed a [Web Dev Bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development) at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/).

During the capstone phase, me and my team built a web app to efficiently store and organize code snippets. The app is built within the Next.js framework and is connected to a MongoDB-backend _via_ a handwritten API. The repo is pinned below.

If you are interested in my work as a philosopher, you might want have to a look at [my book](https://www.amazon.de/Killing-Prevent-Killings-Restrictions-Justifiability/dp/3957431921).

Other than philosophy and coding, my interests include

- chess,
- cycling,
- bouldering, and
- spending time with my son.
